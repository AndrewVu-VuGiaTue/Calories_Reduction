# Calories_Reduction
This is linear regression on the data of `calories burn` . I sample some data from Internet and from people near my house, who went gym regularly, and I wondered myself whether it would help to calculate my `calories burn` based on this dataset

Instead of coding manually the `cost function`, `gradient descent`,... I decided to use library `scikit learn` to save my time as well as practice applying model in this library, as I learnt this library from `Kaggle - Introduction to ML`.
